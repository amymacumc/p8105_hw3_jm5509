## Problem 1

This problem uses the Instacart data.The goal is to do some exploration
of this dataset. How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the
most items ordered from?

``` r
data("instacart")
(instacart %>% group_by(aisle) %>% count() %>% nrow())
```

    ## [1] 134

``` r
(instacart %>% group_by(aisle_id) %>% count() %>% nrow())
```

    ## [1] 134

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>% group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_ordered = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_ordered > 10000) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_ordered)) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n_ordered)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=aisle, x= n_ordered, fill=aisle))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(
     title = "Number of items ordered in every aisle",
      x = "Aisle",
      y = "Number of items ordered") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == c('baking ingredients', 
                    'dog food care', 'packaged vegetables fruits')) %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n_product = n()) %>% 
  filter(min_rank(desc(n_product)) <= 3) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| aisle                      | product_name                                    | n_product |
|:---------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|----------:|
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                               |       157 |
| baking ingredients         | Organic Vanilla Extract                         |       122 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                                |       140 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe             |        13 |
| dog food care              | Organix Grain Free Chicken & Vegetable Dog Food |        14 |
| dog food care              | Original Dry Dog                                |         9 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                            |      3324 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                             |      1692 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                             |      1920 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name == c('Pink Lady Apples','Coffee Ice Cream')) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_order_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(order_dow = recode(order_dow, `0` = 'Sunday', `1` =' Monday',
                            `2` = 'Tuesday', `3` = 'Wednesday',
                            `4` = 'Thursday', `5` = 'Friday',
                            `6` = 'Saturday')) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = order_dow, values_from = mean_order_hour) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## Warning in product_name == c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream"): longer
    ## object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.
